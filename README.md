# Arduino-Crystal-Ball-Project
In this project, we learned to use a Liquid Crystal Display, known better by its abbreviation to LCD. 
Although the LCD is connected to various signals as it receives different types of information, there is already an available Liquid Crystal Library which makes it easier to configure and control the characters displayed on the screen without managing low-level basics of how the screen actually works![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118589401/211933623-dfbf9b69-d26b-41ec-8083-349b9e91dd59.png)
